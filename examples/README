abundant.pl

  Prints the first N abundant (or deficient, or perfect) numbers.  E.g:

  perl abundant.pl 100  abundant
  perl abundant.pl 100  deficient
  perl abundant.pl 15   perfect

sophie_germain.pl

  Prints the first N Sophie-Germain primes.  E.g.:

  perl sophia_germain.pl 100000

twin_primes.pl

  Prints the first N twin-primes (first value of the pair).  E.g.:

  perl twin_primes.pl 100000


find_mr_bases.pl
  
  An example using threads to do a parallel search for good deterministic
  bases for a Miller-Rabin test.  This is definitely not the fastest way
  to find these, but it's a decent example of quickly trying out an idea.
  Be sure to set $nthreads to the right value for your machine.  It should
  fully load your CPUs.


parallel_fibprime.pl

  Find Fibonacci primes, in parallel.  You will want Math::Prime::Util::GMP
  installed, as these are many-thousand-digit numbers.

verify-cert.pl

  Takes an MPU or Primo primality certificate and verifies it.  This is
  obsolete, as Math::Prime::Util::GMP now includes C code for this.

verify-gmp-ecpp-cert.pl

  Parses the verbose output of GMP-ECPP to construct a certificate, then
  runs it through the verification process.

verify-sage-ecpp-cert.pl

  Verifies the output of SAGE's ECPP.  The SAGE module looks like it died
  in development and never got into SAGE.  NZMath's ECPP doesn't seem to
  output a certificate, which makes it much less useful.
