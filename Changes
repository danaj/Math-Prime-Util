Revision history for Perl extension Math::Prime::Util.

0.10  30 June 2012
    - Make miller_rabin return 0 if given even number.
    - Add tests for PP.
    - Cleanup of some tests.
    - The XS miller_rabin code now works with large base > n.
    - Moved prime_count_* and nth_prime_* into Util.pm.  This lets them
      work with big numbers.
    - factor and all_factor should correctly work with bigints.
    - many more bigint/bignum changes
    - factor always returns sorted results

0.09  25 June 2012
    - Pure Perl code added.  Passes all tests.  Used only if the XSLoader
      fails.  It's 1-120x slower than the C code.  When forced to use the
      PP code, the test suite is 38x slower on 64-bit, 16x slower on 32-bit
      (in 64-bit, the test suite runs some large numbers through routines
      like prime_count and nth_prime that are much faster in C).
    - Modifications to threading test:
        - some machines were failing because they use non-TS rand.  Fix by
          making our own rand.
        - Win32 was failing because of unique threading issues.  It barfs
          if you free memory on a different thread than allocated it.
    - is_prime could return 1 in some cases.  Fixed to only return 0 or 2.

0.08  22 June 2012
    - Added thread safety and tested good concurrency.
    - Accuracy improvement and measurements for math functions.
    - Remove simple sieve -- it wasn't being used, and was just around for
      performance comparisons.
    - Static presieve for 7, 11, and 13.  1k of ROM used for prefilling sieve
      memory, meaning we can skip the 7, 11, and 13 loops.  ~15% speedup.
    - Add all_factors function and added tests to t/50-factoring.t.
    - Add tied array module Math::Prime::Util::PrimeArray.
    - 5.6.2 64-bit now disables the 64-bit factoring tests instead of failing
      the module.  The main issue is that we can't verify the factors since Perl
      can't properly multiply them.

0.07  17 June 2012
    - Fixed a bug in next_prime found by Lou Godio (thank you VERY much!).
      Added more tests for this.  This had been changed in another area but
      hadn't been brought into next_prime.

0.06  14 June 2012
    - Change to New/Safefree from malloc.  Oops.

0.05  11 June 2012
    - Speed up mulmod: asm for GCC + x86_64, native 64-bit for 32-bit Perl
      is uint64_t is available, and range tests for others.  This speeds up
      some of the factoring as well as Miller-Rabin, which in turn speeds up
      is_prime.  is_prime is used quite commonly, so this is good.
    - nth_prime routines should now all croak on overflow in the same way.
    - Segmented prime_count, things like this are reasonably efficient:
            say prime_count( 10**16,  10**16 + 2**20 )
    - Add Ei(x), li(x), and R(x) functions.
    - prime_count_approx uses R(x), making it vastly more accurate.
    - Let user override rand for random_prime.
    - Add many more tests with the help of Devel::Cover.

0.04  7 June 2012
    - Didn't do tests on 32-bit machine before release.  Test suite caught
      problem with next_prime overflow.
    - Try to use 64-bit modulo math even when Perl is 32-bit.  It can make
      is_prime run up to 10x faster (which impacts next_prime, factoring, etc.)
    - replace all assert with croak indicating an internal error.
    - Add random_prime and random_ndigit_prime
    - renamed prime_free to prime_memfree.

0.03  6 June 2012
    - Speed up factoring.
    - fixed powmod routine, speedup for smaller numbers
    - Add Miller-Rabin and deterministic probable prime functions.  These
      are now used for is_prime and factoring, giving a big speedup for
      numbers > 32-bit.
    - Add HOLF factoring (just for demo)
    - Next prime returns 0 on overflow

0.02  5 June 2012
    - Back off new_ok to new/isa_ok to keep Test::More requirements low.
    - Some documentation updates.
    - I accidently used long in SQUFOF, which breaks LLP64.
    - Test for broken 64-bit Perl.
    - Fix overflow issues in segmented sieving.
    - Switch to using UVuf for croaks.  What I should have done all along.
    - prime_count uses a segment sieve with 256k chunks (~7.9M numbers).
      Not memory intensive any more, and faster for large inputs.  The time
      growth is slightly over linear however, so expect to wait a long
      time for 10^12 or more.
    - nth_prime also transitioned to segmented sieve.

0.01  4 June 2012
    - Initial release
