- Examine behavior near 32-bit limit on 32-bit machines.
  (done for factoring)

- segment sieve should itself use a segment for its primes.
  Today we'd need sqrt(2^64) max = 140MB.  Segmenting would yield under 1MB.

- Add test to check maxbits in compiled library vs. Perl

- Figure out documentation solution for PP.pm

- Is the current PP.pm setup the way we want to do it?

- Faster SQUFOF.  We're using the faster racing SQUFOF now, but it could still
  use some tuning.

- Move .c / .h files into separate directory.
  version does it in a painful way.  Something simpler to be had?

- finish test suite for bignum.  Work on making it faster.

- After the factoring changes, we need to use Devel::Cover again to ferret
  out numbers that pass the early tests.

- Test all routines for numbers on word-size boundary, or ranges that cross.

- Test all functions return either native or bigints.  Functions that return
  raw MPU::GMP results will return strings, which isn't right.

- Make proper pminus1 in PP code, like factor.c.

- An assembler version of mulmod for i386 would be _really_ helpful for
  all the non-x86-64 Intel machines.

- Dynamically use a mulmodadd in PP aks, just like the new C code does.
  This will mean it'll work for full-size native ints.

- More efficient Mertens.  The current version has poor growth.

- Keep speeding up factoring for very large values.

- More efficient totient segment.  Do we really need primes to n/2?

- Add a more complex system for allowing something like:
      FOREACH_PRIME(low, high) {
        ....
      } END_FOREACH_PRIME
  that (1) handles any low / high, and (2) segments.  Take segment_primes
  from XS.xs to do this.

- Try in lehmer.c's phi function: Use two linear arrays to replace the
  heap+array.  If we add val in one and sval in the other, they can remain
  sorted, then reading the next combined value is easy.

- Implement S2 calculation for LMO prime count.
